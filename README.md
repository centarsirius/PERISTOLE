### PERISTOLE : PackagE that geneRates tIme delay plotS due To gravitatiOnaL lEnsing

PERISTOLE plots the time delay caused due to gravitational lensing and other aspects of a pulsar. Current support exists for graphing :
- latitudinal time delay
- rotational time delay
- geomterical time delay
- gravitational time delay

The inspiration for this project came from papers written by Rafikov & Lai, [2005]( https://doi.org/10.1086/429146), [2006](https://doi.org/10.1086/500346) on the double pulsar system J0737-3039. The speciality of this system being the companion pulsar, which has an almost edge-on configuration w.r.t our line of sight which 
> presents an unprecedented natural laboratory for testing our understanding of general relativity and pulsar magnetosphere physics
